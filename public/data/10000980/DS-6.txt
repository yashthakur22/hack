IMAGING
=====
___ CXR
FINDINGS: 
There is mild pulmonary edema with superimposed region of more 
confluent consolidation in the left upper lung.  There are 
possible small bilateral pleural effusions.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly is again seen as well as tortuosity of the 
descending thoracic aorta.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION: 
Mild pulmonary edema with superimposed left upper lung 
consolidation, potentially more confluent edema versus 
superimposed infection.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old female with history of hypertension, CAD s/p DES 
with ischemic MR and systolic dysfunction, ___, hx of DVT, who 
admitted for CHF exacerbation.

# Acute on chronic decompensated heart failure: presented in the 
setting of high salt diet with dyspnea on exertion, decreased 
exercise tolerance, ___ edema, crackles on exam, elevated BNP to 
10K, 8lbs above dry weight and pulmonary congestion on CXR. 
Later discovered on pharmacy review that patient had not filled 
torsemide after last outpatient Cardiology appointment where she 
was instructed to start taking it. Troponins cycled and 
negative. On admission, she was placed on a salt and fluid 
restricted diet. She was diuresed with IV Lasix 80mg for 2 days 
and then transitioned to po torsemide 40mg with steady weight 
decline and net negative fluid balance of goal -___ and 
stable renal function. Electrolytes repleted for goal Mg>2 and 
K>4. She was continued on home carvedilol 12.5mg BID, 
atorvastatin 80mg daily and lisinopril 40mg daily for blood 
pressure control and increased home nifedipine CR from 30 to 
60mg BID to achieve goal SBP <140. Discharged with close PCP and 
___ to monitor weights and blood pressure 
control.

# Hypertension: She was continued on home carvedilol 12.5mg BID, 
atorvastatin 80mg daily and lisinopril 40mg daily for blood 
pressure control and increased home nifedipine CR from 30 to 
60mg BID to achieve goal SBP <140. 

# Positive U/A: patient asymptomatic but with 32WBCs, ___, 
+bacteria (although 3 epis). Asymptomatic with no 
fevers/dysuria/malaise. Urine culture negative.

# Left upper lung consolidation: infiltrate per Radiology read 
on admission CXR. No cough, fevers, leukocytosis. Rereviewed 
with on-call radiologist who favored pulmonary edema with no 
need for repeat imaging or PNA treatment unless clinically 
indicated. Monitored without any significant clinical findings.

# DVT: anticoagulated on Coumadin goal 2.0-3.0, no signs of 
thrombus on exam. Daily INR trended and continued on home 
Coumadin 5mg daily. 

# Anemia: no signs of external loss, specifically denying any 
melena. Chronically anemic with baseline ___, presented with Hgb 
8. Likely ___ renal disease and ACD however elevated MCV 
indicates possible reticulocytosis. Altogether low suspicion for 
GIB so Coumadin was continued. Reticulocytes 2.4 which is 
inappropriate arguing against acute loss. Trended daily CBC with 
noted uprising by discharge.

# Chronic kidney disease, stage IV- baseline ___, likely ___ 
HTN and DM. Renally dosed medications and trended Cr with no 
significant change. 
# HLD: continued home atorvastatin
# DM: held home 25U 70/30.  Patient maintained on aspart ISS and 
glargine qHS with good glycemic control.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==================
CHF: diuresed with IV lasix, transitioned to po diuretics, 
discharged home on 40mg po torsemide, to take in the AM and take 
a banana. Pt complained of unilateral R-sided incomplete hearing 
loss on day of discharge- was not felt to be related to 
diuretics but would ___.
HTN: increased nifedipine CR to 60mg BID given elevated SBPs. 
Please f/u at next appointments.
Anemia: multiple prior workups showing ACD. Hgb 8s during 
admission
Prior DVT/PE: continued on warfarin, will need continued 
monitoring
DM: stopped home 70/30 while in-house and put on 
aspart/glargine, discharged on home regimen
