History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a past medical

distant MI and bare metal stent, stroke, recent unprovoked DVTs 
on Coumadin, and recent upper GI bleeding, who was sent to ___ 
by her physician for anemia (Hgb 6.5).

The patient was admitted to ___ in ___ with unprovoked 
bilateral lower extremity DVTs. She was started on heparin as an 
inpatient, but anticoagulation was complicated by severely 
elevated PTT (>150) and upper GI bleed. Endoscopy was notable 
for significant erythema, superficial ulceration, and gastritis 
without active bleeding. She was placed on BID PPI prophylaxis. 
She was eventually bridged to Coumadin for a planned 6 month 
course. Her INR is managed by her rehab facility, and she is 
followed by Dr. ___ in ___ clinic. 

For the last two weeks she has noted increasing fatigue along 
with shortness of breath, exertional sub-sternal chest pain 
relieved with rest, and symmetrical lower extremity swelling. 
During this period she reports that her appetite remained good, 
and he bowel function was normal. She denies bloody stools or 
dark stool. On ___ she presented to her PCP office from rehab 
reporting increasing shortness of breath and fatigue. She was 
found to have a Hgb of 6.5, with an unconcerning CXR. She was 
sent to the ___ ED.

In the ED, her initial vitals were T: 97.5 P: 60 BP: 156/76 RR: 
16 SPO2: 100% RA. Exam was notable for guiac negative stool. 
Imaging was notable for:
 "1. Nonocclusive deep vein thrombosis of one of the paired 
posterior tibial veins bilaterally. The extent of thrombus 
bilaterally has decreased. No new deep venous thrombosis in 
either lower extremity. 
 2. Right complex ___ cyst."

The patient was transfused with 2 units of pRBCs, with 
appropriate increase in Hgb to 9.0. Following transfusion, a 
repeat CXR was notable for pulmonary edema with bilateral 
pleural effusions. She was given 20mg PO Lasix and 40mg IV Lasix 
in the ED. The decision was made to admit the patient for anemia 
and flash pulmonary edema. 

On the floor, vitals notable for T: 97.9 BP: 154/75 P: 65 R: 20 
O2: 99RA FSBG: 76. She reports no acute complaints, and that her

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a past medical 
history of type-2 DM, hypertension, stage IV CKD, CAD s/p 
distant MI and bare metal stent, stroke, recent unprovoked DVTs 
on Coumadin, and recent upper GI bleed, who was sent to ___ by 
her physician for anemia. 

# Anemia: 
Patient presented with Hgb of 6.5, down from her recent baseline 
of ~7.5 since her ___ hospitalization. Upon presentation she 
had a new macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative. She 
received two units of packed red cells with an appropriate rise 
in her Hgb to 9.0. Stool was guiac negative, with no reports of 
dark stool or blood in stool. Her hemoglobin remained stable at 
this level, there was no overt bleeding, and her stool was guiac 
negative. After transfusion the patient reported significant 
improvement in her shortness of breath and fatigue. Given her 
history of gastritis and diverticulosis, a GI bleed was believed 
responsible for her anemia. Patient should receive an 
EGD/colonoscopy as an outpatient. 

# Acute exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction: 
The patient was also found to be slightly volume overloaded, and 
was treated with 2x40mg IV Lasix, with good urine output and 
symptomatic improvement. Her pulmonary edema and peripheral 
edema resolved with diuresis.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Gastic ulceration: 
Continued on home pantoprazole BID

# Hypertension:
Continued on home nifedipine, carvadilol, lisinopril.

# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: 
Creatinine remained at baseline (b/l Cr 2.1-2.6) during 
admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
======================
--Patient's Anemia is thought to be due to slow GI bleed given 
history of gastritis and diverticulosis. Please schedule 
EGD/colonoscopy within the next month
--Patient continued on Coumadin for bilateral DVTs; please 
continue to weigh the risks and benefits of anticoagulation 
given history of bleed.
--Discharge weight: 167.7

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you. You were admitted to the 
hospital with fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath. You 
were found to have too few red blood cells (anemia). We gave you 
blood, and your symptoms improved. Additionally, you were found 
to have too much fluid in your legs and lungs. We treated you 
with a diuretic, which helped eliminate the fluid. 

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
