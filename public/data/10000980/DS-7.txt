 IMAGING
==============================
TTE ___: The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. 
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There 
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
basal inferoseptal, inferior, inferolateral as well as mid 
inferior/inferoseptal wall motion abnormalities. Doppler 
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION:   1) Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w 
prior myocardial infarction in the RCA territory.   2) Grade II 
LV diastolic dysfunction.
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, LV 
sytolic function appears mildly less vigorous. Regional wall 
motion abnormalities encompassess slightly greater territory.  

CXR PA & LAT ___: No focal consolidation or pulmonary 
edema.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND ___:   
1. Nonocclusive thrombosis of one of the paired posterior tibial 
veins in the bilateral lower extremities which appears grossly 
unchanged compared to bilateral lower extremity ultrasound ___.  No new deep venous thrombosis in either 
extremity. 
2. Right ___ cyst measuring up to 1.8 cm across maximal 
diameter is 
unchanged in size compared to ___.

T2DM presents with subacute SOB, weight gain, c/f acute heart 
failure exacerbation.  She underwent diuresis with IV Lasix 80 
mg, 120mg IV x2 with rapid improvement in subjective dyspnea.  
___ showed no acute DVT, CXR without sign of consolidation.  
Given her improvement in dyspnea, no supplemental O2 
requirement, the patient was discharged w/o medication changes.

# Shortness of breath
# Hypoxia
# acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure with 
preserved LVEF (50%)
Dry weight per pt 154 lbs.  Admission weight above baseline, BNP 
elevated.  Regarding trigger, suspect dietary vs uncontrolled 
BP. No EKG changes for ACS, trop negative, repeat TTE showed 
mild regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w prior myocardial 
infarction in the RCA territory, as well as Grade II LV 
diastolic dysfunction and similar to prior ___ TTE. Doubt PNA 
given CXR and lack of cough/fever, doubt PE given low Wells' 
score 1.5, and stable repeat ___. Underwent diuresis with IV 
Lasix 80 mg, 120mg IV x2 with rapid improvement in subjective 
dyspnea.  Resumed home torsemide 40mg, nifedipine 60mg BID and 
carvedilol 25mg BID.  Was stable on RA prior to discharge.

# Hypertension - Patient missed her antiHTN medications earlier 
day of admission. Continued home carvedilol 25mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg BID with holding parameters. Appears that a 
trial of ___ or spironolactone would be limited by 
hyperkalemia, so this was deferred.
     
# Urinary frequency/urge incontinence: occurred in setting of 
diuresis, however UCx ordered in ED did grow enterococci, likely 
colonization. If symptoms persists would revaluate/treat.
         
CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES

# Normocytic anemia (recent baseline Hb 9.4 ___ - Hb was at 
baseline, no signs of active bleeding.  Likely multifactorial, 
anemia of chronic disease as well as decreased erythropoiten 
production iso CKD.
 
# Non anion gap metabolic acidosis - Patient has intermittently 
had a NAGMA in the past.  No recent diarrhea.  ___ suspect Type 
IV RTA given advanced age and history of T2DM (both of which can 
cause hyporeninemia).

# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline Cr 2.3-2.8) - CKD 
iso HTN and T2DM, Cr is currently at baseline. Low K/Phos/Na 
diet. Continued home calcitriol, avoided nephrotoxins and 
renally dosed all medications.

# Coronary artery disease ___ DES to LCX ___: troponins were 
trended from < 0.01 to 0.05 to 0.04 then stopped. CK-MB was 
flat.  Patient deneied any chest pain. A TTE showed mild 
regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w prior myocardial infarction 
in the RCA territory and similar to prior ___ TTE. Continued 
home aspirin 81mg qd, home carvedilol 25mg BID with holding 
parameters, home atorvastatin 80mg qHS.
 
# Type II Diabetes Mellitus (last HbA1C 6.4% ___ - Under 
excellent control, most recently in the pre-diabetic range.
- Continue home 70/30 sliding scale (___t dinner if 
blood sugar over 130, 10 units 90-130, none if blood sugar under 
90) 

# Dyslipidemia: continued home atorvastatin

# Insomnia: continued home gabapentin

# Gout: continued home allopurinol

 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==============================
- Discharge weight: 69.2kg
- Discharge creatinine: 2.6
- Discharge oral diuretic: torsemide 40mg daily
- Transitional issue: consider outpatient epo with renal 
- Transitional issue: BP goal of 140/90 per accord or even 
130/80 per ACC/AHA ___ guidelines however anticipate difficulty 
in adding additional agents iso CKD (limits use of clonidine) 
and baseline potassium (would likely limit ___ or 
spironolactone) 
- TTE showed prior LV hypokinesis, could consider MIBI or 
outpatient pharmacological stress test
- had some urinary retention/incontinence while undergoing IV 
diuresis would assess for recurrent symptoms at routine 
outpatient visits

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and 
weight gain.  This was likely caused by an exacerbation of your 
heart failure possibly from salty foods over the holiday. 

While you were in the hospital:
- we gave you IV diuretics to help remove extra fluid
- we checked for pneumonia with a chest x-ray, there was no sign 
of a pneumonia
- we checked for signs on new clots in your legs, there was no 
new clot

Now that you are going home:
- continue to take all of your medications as prescribed
- monitor your salt intake, this should be no more than 2 grams 
every day, ask your doctors for help with this if you do not 
know how to keep track of your salt
- continue to weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
- follow-up with your primary care doctor regarding your blood 
pressure and blood sugar control

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
