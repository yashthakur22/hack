ECG ___  7:56:06 ___  
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. The Q-T interval is 400 
milliseconds. Q waves in leads V1-V2 with ST-T wave 
abnormalities extending to lead V6. Consider prior anterior 
myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of ___ 
atrial premature beats are not seen. The Q-T interval is 
shorter. ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.  
 
CXR ___:
PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions are new since ___. No 
signs of pneumonia or pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart is 
top normal in size though this is stable. Aorta is markedly 
tortuous, unchanged. Aortic arch calcifications are seen. There 
is no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation. Partially imaged 
upper abdomen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Tiny pleural effusions, new. Otherwise unremarkable.

ECHO ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of 
mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate 
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic 
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild-moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased and 
moderate PA hypertension is now identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with h/o hypertension, hypelipidemia, diabetes 
mellitus on insulin, cerebellar-medullary stroke in ___, 
stage ___ CKD followed by Dr ___ presenting with fatigue and 
DOE for a few weeks, markedly worse the morning of admission. 
The patient has known diastolic dysfunction. Of note, she has 
been noncompliant with her medications at home. On arrival to 
the floor, she required hydralazine 20 mg to bring down her BP. 
She has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is 
contributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand 
myonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated 
troponin.

# CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, 
patient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. 
Her only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs 
attributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin 
fell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting 
of renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to 
suggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. 
She was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for 
evidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to 
81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her 
LDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from 
simvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues 
with drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover 
atorvastatin. She was therefore switched to pravastatin 80 mg at 
discharge. From a cardiac standpoint, we did not feel that 
Plavix was necessary for CAD, but her neurologist was contacted 
and wanted Plavix continued. We had to stop metoprolol due to HR 
in the ___ during admission even off metoprolol.
  
# Pump: Last echo in ___ showed low normal LVEF. Her current 
presentation was consistent with CHF exacerbation with bilateral 
pleural effusions, dyspnea, and elevated NT-Pro-BNP. Her TTE 
showed mild-moderate mitral and moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation, LVEF 50-55%, and pulmonary hypertension. We 
changed her HCTZ to Lasix 40 mg PO at discharge. This medication 
can be uptitrated as needed.

# Hypertension: The patient's nephrologist, Dr. ___, agreed 
with our proposed medication adjustments, but recommended 
staying away from clonidine. There has been a H/O medication 
non-adherence. Social work was involved in discharge planning, 
and ___ will be assisting the patient at home. We added 
lisinopril 20 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily and continued 
nifedipine 120 mg daily. Her atenolol was stopped due to her 
renal dysfunction, but her metoprolol had to be stopped due to 
bradycardia. She should continue on once a day medication dosing 
to help with compliance.

# ? COPD: The patient may have a component of COPD as she was 
wheezing on admission and responded to albuterol. She was given 
a prescription for albuterol prn.

Transitional Issues:
- She will be scheduled for outpt stress stress test
- She has follow-up appointments with Dr. ___ and Dr. 
___ and both can work on uptitrating her BP 
meds as needed.
- ___ will need to work with patient on medication compliance.

You will be contacted about an outpatient stress test. This will 
be completed within the next month.

You will be prescribed several new medications as shown below. A 
visiting nurse ___ come to your home to help with managing your 
medications. You should dispose of all your home medications and 
only take the medications shown on this discharge paperwork.

Medications:
STOP Hydrochlorothiazide
STOP Simvastatin
STOP Clonidine
STOP Atenolol due to low heart rate
CHANGE 325mg to 81mg once daily
START Lisinopril 20mg once daily
START Lasix 40mg once daily
