Brief Hospital Course:
Outpatient Providers: ___ with PMHx significant for CAD, HTN, 
HLD, T2DM, CKD stage IV, PVD (s/p in ___, left superficial 
femoral artery), presents with lower left leg numbness and pain, 
found to have bilateral unprovoked DVT. She was treated with a 
heparin drip and had many bleeding events during her stay: she 
developed an upper GIB, had an EGD, and was followed by GI 
during her admission. The heparin drip was stopped and then 
re-started once her coffee-ground emesis resolved. Her stools 
were guiac positive, however no active blood was found on rectal 
exam. GI felt that colonoscopy could be deferred to out patient. 
Additionally she developed a left arm hematoma. The heparin drip 
was stopped and then re-started once her hematoma was felt to be 
stable. She had left radial as well as bilateral lower extremity 
___ dopplerable pulses throughout admission. Hematology was 
consulted after the patient developed a left arm hematoma and 
the drip was slowly uptitrated as per their recommendations. She 
was successfully bridged to coumadin with an INR on discharge of 
2.0. She was discharged to rehab as per ___ recs. 

Please see below for a more problem based/detailed summary and 
transitional issues.

================================================================

___ y/o female with PMHx significant for CAD, HTN, HLD, T2DM, CKD 
stage IV, PVD (s/p in ___, left superficial femoral artery), 
presented with lower Left leg numbness and pain since yesterday 
evening, with ultrasound bilateral lower extremities showing 
bilateral posterior tibial veins DVT's.

# Unprovoked Bilateral DVTs: No clinical signs of PE on 
admission or during stay, positive bilateral DVTs on LENIs. Pain 
and swelling improved on anticoagulation. Patient was bridged 
with heparin drip to therapeutic warfarin with INR goal ___. Due 
to continually supratherapeutic PTT > 150 on heparin drip, 
hematology was consulted and no further workup was deemed 
necessary. Heparin drip was carefully uptitrated as needed. 
Clopidogrel was stopped per outpatient cardiologist. Patient 
will need age-appropriate cancer screening including colonoscopy 
and mammogram. Patient will follow-up in ___ clinic for 
anticoagulation management and should continue on warfarin for 
at least 3 months. 

# Upper GI bleed: Patient developed 1 episode large coffee 
ground emesis while on heparin drip with PTT > 150. Received 2U 
pRBCs. GI consulted and EGD showed gastritis and superficial 
erosions but no active bleeding. Incidental finding of medium 
sized hiatal hernia. Stool h. pylori antigen was negative. GI 
recommended 8 weeks of high dose PPI.

# Left antecubital hematoma: Patient developed large left 
antecubital hematoma in setting of phlebotomy and PTT > 150 on 
heparin gtt. Heparin gtt held while hematoma improved. Repeat 
h/h were stable. 

# Acute on CKD Stage IV: Patient with creatinine of 2.9 on 
admission with baseline 2.0-2.5. Improved with hydration. Home 
lasix and lisinopril were initially held. Home lasix restarted 
on discharge at 20mg daily. 

# Normocytic Anemia: Patient has normocytic anemia. Rectal exam 
in ED was guaiac negative. In past treated with aransep as well 
as EPO. Etiology likely related to underlying CKD, however also 
must consider slow GI bleed (patient has gastritis/duodenitis on 
EGD but no evidence of active bleeding. Iron studies were 
normal. 

# HFpEF: Home furosemide and Lisinopril were held on admission 
for ___ followed by GI bleed. Carvedilol and nifedine were held 
in setting of GIB (see above). Nifedipine was restarted at 30mg 
bid and lasix was decreased from 40mg to 20mg daily.

# CAD: hx of MI in ___ BMS to circumflex and POBA ___. Per 
discussions with Dr. ___, patient's cardiologist, 
clopidogrel was held given GI bleed and initiation of warfarin. 
Lasix initially held as above, but restarted on discharge at 
20mg daily. Home ASA, statin, and carvedilol were continued. 

# HTN: Nifedipine was decreased to 30mg BID from 60mg BID given 
multiple bleeding episodes and normal blood pressures. Home 
carvedilol continued. Patient's nifedipine was decreased to 30mg 
daily given acute bleed and SBPs in the ___
Lasix was decreased from 40 daily to 20 daily.
 
# Diabetes Mellitus: Stable on home 30 units 70/30 insulin at 
bedtime.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Out patient hypercoaguability work up including screening 
colonoscopy (last in ___ and mammogram

PPI (started 40mg pantoprazole PO twice daily on ___ with 
projected end date ___ for upper GI bleed likely from 
gastritis.
- Patient's hypertension medications (Lisinopril and nifedipine) 
were held due to upper GI bleed.
- Patient's furosemide was decreased to 20mg daily
- Patient's nifedipine was decreased to 30mg daily given acute 
bleed and SBPs in the ___
- Patient was started on Coumadin. Clopidogrel was stopped per 
cardiology. ASA 81mg was continued.
- Please address patient's home environment for fall risk given 
recent "trip" at home and new anticoagulation.
- please ensure patient has outpatient anticoagulation follow-up 
and management upon discharge from rehab

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
leg swelling and pain. Diagnostic tests were performed and you 
were diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis, blood clots in your 
legs. You were treated with blood thinning medications that you 
will continue at home. You had an episode of upper GI bleeding 
during your stay for which you are being treated with medication 
and you underwent an EGD. You developed a left arm hematoma as 
well during your stay which will resolve on its own over time.

For your blood clots, you were started on a new drug called 
warfarin. You will need to have your blood checked to adjust the 
dosing. For your upper GI bleed, you were started on 
Pantoprazole 40mg twice daily. You will continue this drug as an 
outpatient for at least 8 weeks. Additionally, you will no 
longer be taking Clopidogrel (Plavix), until you speak with your 
cardiologist.

It was a pleasure taking care you during your hospital stay.

Best wishes,

Your ___ Care Team
