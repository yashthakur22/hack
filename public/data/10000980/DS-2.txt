CXR: ___
Right upper lobe pneumonia or mass.  However, given right hilar 
fullness, a mass resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia is 
within the 
differential.  Recommend chest CT with intravenous contrast for 
further 
assessment. 

TTE: ___
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
near-akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and basal lateral 
segments. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 
35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet 
of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional LV wall motion abnormalities are new. Severity of 
mitral regurgitation has increased.

CARDIAC CATH: ___
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no 
obstructive disease.  The LAD had a moderate disease in the mid 
artery and a diagonal branch had an 80% proximal lesion.  The 
Lcx had a 70% proximal lesion.  The RCA was totally occluded 
mid-vessel. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Recommend CABG evaluation

CT CHEST: ___
1.  Diffuse confluent ground-glass opacities predominantly in 
the right upper lobe and right lower lobe most likely represent 
residual pulmonary edema, localized to the right lung because of 
direction of jet in mitral 
regurgitation.  
2.  Possible pulmonary hypertension. 
3.  Moderate coronary artery disease. 

CAROTID US: ___
No evidence of hemodynamically significant internal carotid 
stenosis on either side. 

ECHO ___- PCI)
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. An eccentric jet of mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the LVEF has increased. The degree of MR seen has decreased. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with ___, HTN, diabetes, CKD presented with 
increased dyspnea and non-productive cough without fevers or 
elevated white count, initially admitted to ___ with concern 
for pneumonia. However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme 
leak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent 
cardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, 
lactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary 
edema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who 
transferred the patient to cardiology floor.

# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation/mitral regurgitation: 
Likely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in 
worsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior 
wall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac 
cath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically 
with lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was 
consulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair/replacement. 
However, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high 
risk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made 
to revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient 
would regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a 
bare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in 
the diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her 
mitral regurgitation. 

# NSTEMI/CAD:
As evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was 
briefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac 
catheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed 
3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with 
aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As 
the patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to 
the cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA. She will 
require plavix for at least 1 month.

# Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive. Continued 
nifedipine at half of her home dose. Continued on lisinopril. 
She was also started on metoprolol as above for CHF.

# Diabetes: Continued home insulin regime. 
 
# CKD stage IV: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.8 per renal notes. Currently 
at baseline. 

# History of CVA: Continued home aspirin and clopidogrel. 

# GERD: Continued home ranitidine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
* Will need follow up with a cardiologist. Patient will be 
scheduled to follow up with the first available CMED 
cardiologist. 
* Will need plavix for at least one month (day of bare metal 
stent placement = ___.
* Atorvastatin dose increased to 80mg (per pharmacy, her 
insurance will cover. Her co-pay will be $10/month).
* Consider titrating nifedipine dose back to 120mg if still 
hypertensive. 
* Please recheck Chem7 at next appointment to evaluate for ___ 
secondary to dye received during cardiac catheterization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. As you recall, you were admitted for shortness 
of breath. This was because one of your heart valves was weak, 
which caused fluid to build up in your lungs. Your heart valve 
was weak because there was a blockage in one of your heart 
arteries. You underwent a procedure, called cardiac 
catheterization, which opened up the blocked arteries. Your 
valve and heart are pumping much more efficiently now. We are 
glad you are feeling better. Please weigh yourself every 
morning, and call your MD if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs 
over 24 hours.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
