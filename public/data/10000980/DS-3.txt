Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and chest tightness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ Pharmacologic nuclear stress test
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with history of HTN, HLD, hx of CVA, CAD s/p 
BMS to circumflex and POBA (___), on Aspirin and Plavix, CHF 
(EF 45% in ___, diabetes, presenting with acute onset 
shortness of breath and substernal chest tightness since ___ 
evening. 

Patient notes that ___ evening had a large seafood dinner 
which is not usual for her, and then later around 10pm had acute 
onset of SOB feeling like she could not take deep breaths with 
chest tightness (patient notes this is her "angina"). Denies 
pleuritic component to CP, described as central and across lower 
rib cage, persistent since onset, no radiation to the 
shoulders/jaw/back, no diaphoreses. Worsens with activity, 
improves somewhat with rest. Patient does not it feels like 
other episodes when she then required her stent placement. Took 
a SLNx1, which improved her symptoms though these persisted, but 
almost immediately led to abdominal discomfort with vomiting x1, 
nonbloody with dinner pieces. ___, 1 day prior to admission, 
decided to see if her pain improved on its own, then when it 
persisted on ___, husband arranged for UC appt at ___ 
___. At PCP, ___, SBP up to 200s, EKG with ST 
depressions in the precordial leads, specifically V3, V4 and V5, 
given full dose ASA and SLNx1, and sent to the ED given concern 
for ACS versus HTN emergency. 

Patient reporting baseline sleeps with 2 pillows, unchanged 
recently, no cough, PND, orthopnea with 2 pillows. Worsening DOE 
since onset of symptoms, now unable to complete a block where 
she used to be able to walk a few blocks at a time without 
stopping ___ SOB/CP. Denies new ___ edema (baseline says L leg > 
R).

Also had emesis last night x 1; no diaphoresis, no chest pain, 
no radiation of symptoms anywhere. No diarrhea or constipation, 
no dysuria, no focal weakness/numbness. On ROS, also with some L 
leg tingling intermittently, stable and chronic. Had diarrhea x1 
on ___ following ___ seafood dinner, normal BMs since 
then. 
 
In the ED initial vital signs; T 98 P 88 BP 190/120 R 18 O2 Sat 
98% 3L nasal cannula. Labs notable for Cr 2.1 (baseline 
2.1-2.7), BUN 29. wbc 4.3, H/H 8.6/26.0, Plt 147. Initial and 
rpt Tn <0.01. BNP 4279. CXR showed no pulmonary edema, pleural 
effusions, or consolidation, borderline cardiomegaly. The 
patient received carvedilol, nebulizers, and IV lasix. It is 
unclear how much UOP the patient has as it was not documented in 
the ED. 

The patient was seen by cardiology in the ED who felt that in 
the setting of systolic heart failure, her dyspnea was likely 
due to a CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary 
indiscretion. Diuresis was recommended in addition to increasing 
carvedilol to 12.5mg BID, as well as a nuclear stress test this 
morning.

On the floor, the patient c/o of some improved dyspnea/chest 
tightness as well as wheezing (no COPD/asthma history, no 
significant smoking history), but otherwise has no acute 
complaints. Given her continued SOB and wheezing, she was 
written for nebulizers and steroids for reactive airway disease 
overnight.

==== IMAGING ====

___ CHEST (PA AND LAT):
The lungs are clear of consolidation, effusion, or edema. 
Cardiac silhouette is top normal. Descending thoracic aorta is 
tortuous with atherosclerotic calcification seen at the arch. No 
acute osseous abnormalities identified. 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

___ P-MIBI:
Clinical Indication: SS CHEST TIGHTNESS ASSESS FOR EVIDENCE OF 
ISCHEMIA  
HISTORY: ___ yo woman with a history of CAD and CHF referred for 
evaluation of chest pain and dyspnea.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation dipyridamole was 
infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 
milligram/kilogram/min. She had no anginal symptoms or ischemic 
ECG changes.

TECHNIQUE: 
ISOTOPE DATA: (___) 11.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest; 
(___) 29.6 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress; DRUG DATA: (Non-NM 
admin) Dipyridamole;

IMAGING METHOD:
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
Tracer was injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining 
the resting images. 
Following resting images and following intravenous infusion, 
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi 
was administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained 
approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. 
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT. 
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model. 

FINDINGS: 
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast attenuation.
Left ventricular cavity size is increased.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium. 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 59% with an 
EDV of 117 ml.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 
2. Increased left ventricular cavity size with normal systolic 
function.
Compared with prior study of ___, the cavity size is 
larger.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of HTN, CVA, CAD (s/p BMS to 
circumflex in ___, CHF (EF 45% in ___ who presented 
with acute onset shortness of breath and substernal chest 
tightness.

# Shortness of breath:
Patient with acute onset SOB following seafood meal with 
associated chest tightness (see below). Patient with crackles 
and expiratory rhonchi on lung exam. CXR did not show 
significant pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or consolidation 
although her BNP was elevated. Per pharmacy records, patient had 
not refilled lasix prescription since ___. Overall, 
presentation was most consistent with a mild CHF exacerbation. 
She received treatment with IV lasix and her shortness of breath 
subsequently improved quickly. She was able to be transitioned 
to a PO regimen of lasix 40mg qday on ___ (day of discharge). 
Dry weight on day of discharge was 75.9kg.

# Chest Tightness:
Patient reported chest tightness associated with her shortness 
of breath. Was given aspirin and SL nitroglycerin in her PCP's 
office prior to being directed to the ED. Troponin was negative 
x2. EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Due to her 
significant CAD history, she underwent a P-MIBI on ___ which 
was unremarkable. Her chest tightness was thought to be of 
non-cardiac etiology.

# HTN:
Patient presented with SBP of 190-200. Cardiology was consulted 
and recommended increasing her carvedilol from 6.25mg BID to 
12.5mg BID. With this change, and continuation of her other home 
medications, her blood pressure decreased to systolics in range 
of 110-146 on day of discharge. It is unclear whether her very 
elevated BP on admission was occurring in the setting of 
medication non-compliance. Nifedipine was decreased from BID to 
daily given increased carvedilol and addition of Lasix (which 
patient was believed to have been non-compliant with prior to 
this admission).

==== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ====

# CHF:
- ___ services for medication teaching and pill-box, as well as 
weights
- Follow up with her cardiologist Dr. ___ on ___
- Please check repeat Chem-10 and CBC on ___
- Continue furosemide 40mg qday

# Hct Drop: Patient with chronic anemia and Hgb drop on day of 
discharge from 9.3 to 8.5.
- Repeat CBC check on ___

# HTN:
- Increased carvedilol to 12.5mg BID
- Nifedipine was decreased from BID to daily given increased 
carvedilol and addition of lasix (with which patient was likely 
non-compliant prior to this admission).

# Health Screening
- Patient is due for colonoscopy this year.
- PCP follow up with Dr. ___ on ___

# Weight at discharge: 75.9 kg

# Code: Full (confirmed with patient)
