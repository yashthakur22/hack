Brief Hospital Course:
#Abdominal distention/pain:
She was treated empirically due to concern for spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis with ceftriaxone 2g x 1.  A diagnostic 
paracentesis was performed in the ED.  Ascitic fluid analysis 
was performed.  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was ruled out 
given that the fluid cell count showed only 52 WBC; antibiotics 
were discontinued in this setting.  Subsequently, a large volume 
paracentesis was performed on ___ with 4.5L of fluids 
removed. After the procedure, her abdomen was less distended and 
less painful.  Fluid analysis again did not reveal SBP.  
.
#Alcoholic hepatitis:
Patient's liver synthetic function was monitored while 
hospitalized. She was maintained on her home regimen of 
lactulose. She also had 24-hr urine collection for copper to 
evaluate for ___ disease. 
.
#Leukocytosis and mild fever:
She had a temparature of 101 upon presentation in the ED.  She 
had no signs or symptoms of any infection.  Urine culture showed 
only GU flora, consistent with contamination. After arrival to 
the floor her temperature was stable, ranging from 99 to 101.  
Her WBC trended down throughout the hospitalization and was 11 
at the time of discharge.    
.
#Tachycardia:
Her heart rate was elevated in the 100-120s throughout the 
hospitalization. She had good oxygenation and had no complaints 
of SOB, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations. The most likely 
etiology of this is pain, anxiety, and her low intravascular 
volume.  She was tachycardic in the 100s upon discharge.  
.
#Back pain:
Lumbosacral spine film revealed no skeletal abnormalities 
(vertebral compression fracture and osteomyelitis).  Her pain 
was present but well-controlled throughout the hospitalization 
with oxycodone ___ Q6H PRN pain.  Recommended follow up with 
her primary care provider to address management of her chronic 
pain. 
.

Low sodium (2g/day), fluid restriction (1500mL/day)
.
