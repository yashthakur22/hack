Brief Hospital Course:
This ___ year old female was admitted to the hospital and was 
made NPO, IV fluids were started and she had a nasogastric tube 
placed.  She was pan cultured for a temperature of 101 and was 
followed with serial KUB's and physical exam. Her nasogastric 
tube was clamped on hospital day 2 and she soon developed

pelvis.  This demonstrated an increase in the degree of 
obstruction and she was subsequently taken to the operating room 
for the aforementioned procedure.

tube in place and treated with IV fluids.  Her pain was 
initially controlled with a morphine PCA .  Her nasogastric tube 
was removed on post op day #2 and she began a clear liquid diet 
which she tolerated well.  This was gradually advanced over 36 
hours to a regular diet and was tolerated well.  She was having 
bowel movements and tolerated oral pain medication.  Her
