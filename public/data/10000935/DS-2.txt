CT abdomen/pelvis
1. Innumerable hepatic and pulmonary metastases.  No obvious 
primary 
malignancy is identified on this study. 
  
2. No evidence of small bowel obstruction, ischemic colitis, 
fluid collection, 
or perforation. 

CXR: 
 
New nodular opacities within both upper lobes, left greater than 
right. 
Findings are compatible with metastases, as was noted in the 
lung bases on the 
subsequent CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed later the same 
day. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ Female with PMH significant for depression, 
hyperlipidemia, Hysterectomy, B12 deficiency, OA, carcinoid, 
cervical DJD, depression, SBO who presented with nausea, 
vomiting, weakness x 2 weeks and was found to have multiple 
liver and lung masses per CT consistent with metastatic cancer 
of unknown primary. 

Patient was treated with IV fluids overnight for dehydration. 
She refused to stay in the hospital for any further work-up or 
treatment and stated she would rather go home to to think and 
see to her affairs over the weekend and consider pursuing 
further work-up as an outpatient. She tolerated oral fluids well 
w/o vomiting. She remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile 
throughout her stay. 

Of note patient has psychiatric history of depressive symptoms 
and isolation tendencies. She denied any SI/SA or any risk to 
herself.  She has little social supports but does have a good 
relationship with her driver and friend who came in and was 
updated by the medical team on the morning of discharge and will 
be taking her home. She sees a mental health provider at ___ 
once a month and has a good relationship with her primary care 
physician. Patient was dischaerged home at her request. Home 
medications were continued to which we added some symptomatic 
treatment for her cough with benzonatate and Guaifenesin. We 
held off on anti-emetics for now as she did not want to stay 
inhouse to make sure these would be well tolerated (would need 
to monitor for drug interactions given multiple QTc prolonging 
and serotonergic medications on her home meds).  She was 
instructed to maintain good hydration and try a soft diet at 
home if she can not tolerate regular diet. The patient met with 
SW who provided her with resources for community councelling. 
Outpatient appointments with oncology, GI and her PCP were set 
up and her PCP and mental health provider were updated. Her PCP 
___ also ___ with her later today by telephone.
