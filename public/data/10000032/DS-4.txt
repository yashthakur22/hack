# Goals of care:  The patient expressed that her desire to "let 
go" and be at peace. She is tired of "fighting" her end stage 
liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of 
life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, 
which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would 
like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the 
patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably 
be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). 
Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also 
discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter 
placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged 
to home with hospice on ___.

# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient 
presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed 
with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis 
on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies 
on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant 
improvement in her pain.
 
# Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that 
she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. 
After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x 
2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been 
persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be 
monitored.

# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 
on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose 
in-house and at discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============

# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic 
hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia 
related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis 
dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic 
through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 
10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she 
will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.

# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were 
continued in-house and at discharge.  

# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued 
in-house and at discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture
[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)
[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have 
biweekly BMPs (script written). If K > 5.3, she should be given 
kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. 
___.
[ ] Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement 
and code status.
[ ] She will continue to have twice weekly paracenteses

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely 
that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from 
your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid 
was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to 
have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came 
down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as 
an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a 
representative from hospice. Because of your repeated 
paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex 
catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice 
coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.

We wish you all the best!

Your ___ care team
