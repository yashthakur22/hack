peaked T waves. Her head CT was negative for any acute 
processes. She received ceftriaxone 2gm x1, regular insulin 10U, 
calcium gluconate 1g, lactulose 30 mL x2, and 25g 5% albumin.

decompensated (ascites requiring biweekly therapeutic 
paracenteses, hepatic encephalopathy; not on transplant list ___ 
comorbidities) w/ AMS, hypotension, ___, and hyperkalemia. 
Altered mental status improved with lactulose. Hypotension was 
felt to be due to fluid shifts from paracentesis on the day 
prior to admission as well as low PO intake in the setting of 
AMS. Hypotension and ___ resolved with IV albumin. Hyperkalemia 
resolved with insulin and kayexalate.

# Hypotension: Patient presented with SBP in ___ and improved 
with albumin in the ED to ___. It was felt to be due to 
fluid shifts from paracentesis on ___, as well as likely 
hypovolemia given AMS and decreased PO intake. No concern for 
bleeding or sepsis with baseline CBC and lack of fever. She 
continued to received IV albumin during her hospital course, 
with which her SBP improved to ___ and patient remained 
asymptomatic.  

# Hyperkalemia: Patient presented with K 6.7 with EKG changes. 
Given low Na, likely the result of low effective arterial volume 
leading to poor K excretion, with likely exacerbation from ___. 
AM cortisol was normal. K improved with insulin and kayexalate 
and K was 5.2 on day of discharge. Bactrim was held during 
hospital course. 

# ___: Patient presented with Cr 0.7 from baseline Cr is 
0.3-0.4. It was felt to be likely due to volume shift from her 
paracentesis on the day prior to admission as well as now low 
effective arterial volume, likely ___ poor PO intake ___ AMS. Cr 
improved to 0.4 with albumin administration. Furosemide and 
Bactrim were held during hospital course.   

#GOC: The ___ son (HCP) met with Dr. ___ 
outpatient hepatologist) during ___ hospital course. They 
discussed that the patient is not a transplant candidate 
givenevere underlying lung disease (FEV1 ~0.8), hypoxia, RV 
dilation and very low BMI. A more conservative approach was 
recommended and the patient was transitioned to DNR/DNI. The 
patient agreed with this plan. She was treated with the goal of 
treating any any correctable issues. Social work met with the 
patient prior to discharge. The patient was interested in 
following up with palliative care, for which an outpatient 
referral was made. 
 
# Altered Mental Status: Patient presented with confusion that 
was most likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Based on 
outpatient records, patient has had steady decline in 
decompensated cirrhosis and mental status. No signs of infection 
and head CT was negative as well. Mental status improved with 
lactulose in the ED and patient reports that she has not been 
taking lactulose regularly at home. Patient was also continued 
on rifaximin.   

# HCV Cirrhosis: Genotype 3a. Patient is decompensated with 
increasing ascites and worsening hepatic encephalopathy. She is 
dependent on twice weekly paracentesis. Spironolactone was 
recently stopped due to hyperkalemia. Patient is not a 
transplant candidate given her comorbidities COPD per outpatient 
hepatologist. The patient would like to continue biweekly 
paracenteses as an outpatient.

# HIV: Most recent CD4 count 173 on ___. HIV viral load on 
___ was undetectable. She was continued on her home regimen 
of raltegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Bactrim 
prophylaxis was held during admission because of hyperkalemia.   


# COPD: Patient on 3L NC at home. She was continued on her home 
regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ because of confusion, low blood 
pressure, and a high potassium value. Your confusion improved

and your potassium improved as well. You also had small degree 
of kidney injury when you came to the hospital, and this also 
improved with fluids. While you were here, you discussed 
changing your goals of care to focusing on symptom management 
and treatment of reversible processes, such as an infection. 
While you were in the hospital, you were seen by one of our 
social workers. You will also follow up with Palliative Care in 
their clinic and will continue to have therapeutic paracenteses.

It has been a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you all 
the best,
Your ___ Care team
